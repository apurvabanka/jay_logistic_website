# 3D Motor Demo

This is a simple static website that displays a 3D model of a motor using [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## How to use

- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the 3D motor demo.
- The 3D model is loaded from `assets/motor_placeholder.glb`.
- You can rotate, zoom, and pan the model using your mouse.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push the contents of this folder to your GitHub repository (e.g., `main` or `gh-pages` branch).
2. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and set the source to the root or `/docs` folder as appropriate.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/`.

## Replacing the 3D Model

- Replace `assets/motor_placeholder.glb` with your own GLTF/GLB model of a motor.
- Make sure the file is named `motor_placeholder.glb` or update the path in `index.html` accordingly.
